For execution on a local, multicore CPU with excess RAM we recommend calling
options(mc.cores = parallel::detectCores()).
To avoid recompilation of unchanged Stan programs, we recommend calling
rstan_options(auto_write = TRUE)

Chain 3 Exception: Exception: integrate_ode_rk45: initial state[1] is inf, but must be finite! (in '/var/folders/w9/nrh3kr0x6sx3_3c6gg9pk0fc0000gn/T/RtmpOJQOUE/model-43a55a22311.stan', line 40, column 6 to column 112) (in '/var/folders/w9/nrh3kr0x6sx3_3c6gg9pk0fc0000gn/T/RtmpOJQOUE/model-43a55a22311.stan', line 40, column 6 to column 112)
Chain 3 If this warning occurs sporadically, such as for highly constrained variable types like covariance matrices, then the sampler is fine,
Chain 3 but if this warning occurs often then your model may be either severely ill-conditioned or misspecified.

Warning messages:
1: Relative effective sample sizes ('r_eff' argument) not specified.
For models fit with MCMC, the reported PSIS effective sample sizes and 
MCSE estimates will be over-optimistic. 
2: Some Pareto k diagnostic values are too high. See help('pareto-k-diagnostic') for details.
